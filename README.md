# CurlSwiggerLabs

This repository contains writeups and solutions for PortSwigger Web Security Academy lab exercises but using basic tools instead of Burp Suite for the sheer enjoyment of learning and understanding web security, I know it's terribly unpractical but it's also more fun and challenging.

## Documented Labs

This section contains solutions and explanations for various PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs. Each lab includes a link to its detailed documentation in the `docs` directory.
